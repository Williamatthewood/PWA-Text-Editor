# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description

J.A.T.E is exactly what it stands for - Just Another Text Editor. It's a PWA, so you can download it and use it offline on your own machine, and it'll sync back up to the database next time you connect online. To save your code, simply click away from the editor window, and all the changes are automatically pushed to the database.
